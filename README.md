# Environment Setup

If you want to write code then you have to install and configure extra software to make it possible. This is called your **development environment**.Let's get your development environment set up!

The tools we'll be installing fall into four, rough categories:

- üõ†Ô∏è **Management Tools** for interacting with and managing your development environment
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Authoring Tools** for writing and navigating code
- üî¨ **Viewing Tools** for viewing the results of your code
- üí¨ **Collaboration Tools** for communicating and working on code with other people

Where macOS and Windows differ the most is in how the development environment is set up and managed. The authoring, viewing, and collaboration tools will be 95%+ identical. That's the good news.

The bad news is that the management tools will be more like ~20% similar.

Is this list **mandatory**? If you're asking then the answer is almost certainly "yes". It's **critical** that you get this done, but getting it done because we "assigned" it will almost certainly mean you miss some essential steps.

Here's the bottom line: we want everyone's computers set up similarly so that time spent working together involves, well, *working* together and not navigating the differences in our computer setups.

Even something as simple as sharing a screenshot and asking "Does anyone's screen *not* look like *this*?" becomes complicated if everyone's computer looks different.

### Help Us Make Collaboration Easy

In school, you are typically only ever producing work for yourself or the TA/professor who grades it. Heck, in many computer science courses the daily/weekly homework is graded automatically by a computer program ‚Äî no humans in sight!

In that environment, it doesn't really hurt to work a way that makes collaboration harder. In this environment, it will hurt a lot.

Here are some ways that having a different development setup *makes collaboration harder*:

- **Preparing written material**

  Let's say you played around with a new tool/technology and want to write a how-to guide for your classmates. For all you know, everyone's machine is configured differently.

  What will you do to

- **Helping classmates when they're stuck**

  Are you *sure* they understood your suggestion as you intended? Are you sure your suggestion will do what *you* expected in *their* environment?

- **Getting help from classmates when *you're* stuck**

  Imagine you're stuck on a project and ask a classmate for help. They offer offer download a copy of your project, run it on their own computer, and see if they can figure out what's going wrong.

  But, oops, because your computer was set up differently, the steps to get the project running did not work as you expected. Rather than spending 60 minutes helping you, they spend the first 45 minutes trying to get the project running and the last 15 minutes helping.

In general, if you don't know that everyone's computers share a common development environment then you will always be paying a hefty "communication tax". Every time you want to interact with someone else around code you will have to make sure you're looking at and talking about the same thing. This applies to teachers, students, mentors ‚Äî everyone.

### Do It For Each Other <!-- omit in toc -->

So, yes, below is a list of things you **need** to do. It's natural to think of this as a personal assignment for you and you alone. Either you've checked everything off or you haven't. Maybe you're ok only doing like 90% of them ‚Äî that's still an **A-**, right?

That might be a reasonable decision on an exam or a quiz, but in this case that last 10% is being paid and re-paid every every time you interact with someone else. Don't do it because we assigned it as "homework", do it because you care about making collaboration between you and your classmates as smooth as possible.

<!-- ### On Mandatory Things

It's important to be clear and thorough about what we want, but writing lists like this (especially in a classroom context) can be a catch-22.

On the one hand, if we say this list is **mandatory** then many students will move through the list like it's a minfield. Stop! Don't move more than an inch! One wrong step and it's the end. "The end of what, exactly?", one might ask. [The world may never know.][youtube-tootsie-owl]

Other students will question what exactly "mandatory" means. They'll try to find exactly where the line is. What happens if I don't do one of the steps? Two of them? 5% of them? Are you *really* going to fail me, etc. if I don't do *one* of the steps?

On the other hand, if we say completing this list is **strongly recommended** but not **mandatory** then students will be all over the map in terms of how much they get done and how seriously they take it. Half the students will read "strongly recommended" as "optional" and either decide not to do it or save it for the last minute. -->

### All Plans Are Doomed, but Especially This One

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.
>
> ‚Äî Dwight D. Eisenhower

You're about to reach deep into your computer and do some things that might feel uncomfortable or even dangerous. Here two are things to keep in mind:

1. **You won't destroy your computer**

   Nothing can go wrong here that will break your computer. Everything can be undone, although you might need help to undo it.

   That said, backing up your computer before you start on something like this is never a *bad* idea.

1. **Yes, this is frustrating**

   Setting up your development environment for the first time is a long, *path-dependent* process. "Path-dependent" means that the task involves (1) multiple steps which (2) have to be completed in a *specific order* and where (3) the success of each step requires the success of all the previous steps.

   Long, path-dependent tasks can quickly become overwhelming because one mistake often means starting over from scratch. And few things are more frustrating than having to start over when the finish line is in sight.

   If you want a game that explores this feeling directly, check out [*Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy*][youtube-getting-over-it]. We rate it six yams üç†üç†üç†üç†üç†üç†.

You might be thinking, "Gosh, I'd better get all the steps correct, then! I'm going to read everything ten times and triple check my work." üö® Eee-ooo üö® eee-ooo üö® eee-ooo üö®. **Stop that thought!**

Before you go on, accept the following fact: no matter how carefully you follow along, you're going to mess up some of these steps.

No, seriousy, **re-read that**. ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è You. Will. Mess. Up.

Why? Each step has a million ways of going wrong, but only one way of going right. Here are a few scenarios:

- You were *sure* you followed every step, but somehow glossed over or misread a critical section (or even just a sentence).
- Your computer is configured in a way that we've never seen before and some of the steps fail as a result.
- The instructions were written 8 months ago. Since then, some of the software we ask you to install and configure has changed in a way that makes the instructions outright wrong.
- etc.

That said, *messing up* is only a problem if you if you define **success** as performing every step in this guide without error. We'd rather your picture of **success** look like:

1. Not letting the frustration of getting a step "wrong" overwhelm you
1. Learning to recognize when something isn't going according to plan
1. Starting to develop a set of practicies and tools to help re-orient yourself when something goes sideways (because something *always* goes sideways)
1. Tackling the tasks ASAP so that those inevitable mistakes happen early and you can correct them without time pressure

Time to install some software.

## Software To Install

"Program", "application", and "software" are all synonyms here.

Remember, the tools we'll be installing fall into four, rough categories:

- üõ†Ô∏è **Management Tools** for interacting with and managing your development environment
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Authoring Tools** for writing and navigating code
- üî¨ **Viewing Tools** for viewing the results of your code
- üí¨ **Collaboration Tools** for communicating and working on code with other people

### All Platforms

- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è  **Visual Studio Code** (<https://code.visualstudio.com/>)

  Visual Studio Code (also called **VS Code**) is an excellent code editor from Microsoft. This is what we will be using to write code.

  See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code>

  > ‚ùó**macOS Users**
  >
  > On macOS, the download for VS Code is a `.zip` file. You will find it in your `Downloads` folder. When you double click it, it will extract an application file named `Visual Studio Code` into the `Downloads` folder.
  >
  > It's important you move the `Visual Studio Code` application to the `Applications` folder before running it. Running a program from the `Downloads` folder can cause surprising behaivor down the road, e.g., settings not saving correctly, files getting saved to strange locations, etc.

- [ ] üí¨ **Discord** (<https://discord.com/>)

  Discord is a text and voice chat service designed primarily for people who play video games. It has "voice rooms", which make it easy to see when teachers are around and available to talk.

  No wondering, "Should I bother the instructor right now? Are they busy?"

- [ ] üí¨ **Zoom** (<https://zoom.us/download>)

- [ ] üí¨ **Loom** (<https://www.loom.com/>)

  Loom is a tool that makes it easy to make a recording of your computer screen and share it. These are called **screen recordings**. It can also (optionally) access your computer's microphone and camera, allowing you to overlay them on top of the screen recording.

  [Loom Pro][url-loom-pro-free] is free for students and teachers.

  Some examples of how you might use Loom:

  - Narrated product walkthroughs or tutorials
  - Creating a visual record of a bug in someone's program so that you don't have to rely on a purely textual description. This could be a bug in your *own* program that you want help with or a bug in someone else's program that you want to point out to them.
  - Recording + sharing a presentation if your internet is too unreiable to do it over Zoom

- [ ] üî¨ **Major Browsers**

  Install all the major browsers. You will need to see how your websites look to other people. Yes, [Microsoft Edge is also available on macOS][url-msft-edge-macos].

  - [ ] Microsoft Edge (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge>)
  - [ ] Google Chrome (<https://www.google.com/chrome/>)
  - [ ] Firefox (<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>)

  We recommend using either Chrome or Firefox for your main browser.
